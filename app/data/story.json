Now available up and down the east coast (in markets from Connecticut to Virginia), the burger doesn’t crumble like other meatless burgers, and it even earned a thumbs up from Craig Laban, who called it “a well-crafted mouthful of sweet and spicy.” At the deli, it comes with remarkably smoky gouda, sauteed mushrooms and ‘mushroom mayo.’ Another specialty is their gluten-free energy soup, a warming blend of beans, kale, quinoa, seaweed, and flax seed."

The owners were inspired by the texture of Japanese and Chinese pastries, co-owner Rebecca Foxman said, which typically use a blend of rice flour and corn starch. Their entirely gluten-free menu includes corn dogs, fried broccoli bites, fried cheese curds, funnel cake, and poutine (including a vegan option). The vegan iteration of their funnel cake, the owners report, also saves food waste: they use ripe bananas that produce stands at Reading Terminal would get rid of at the end of the day to replace the buttermilk and eggs in their traditional funnel cake recipe. The store also recently appeared on the Rachael Ray Show."

Rather than using the ubiquitous Daiya cheese, a commercially available vegan cheese made of coconut oil and tapioca, owner Mark Mebus uses Violife cheese, as the Inquirer reported in 2018. According to Mebus, Violife is ‘the most meltable and convincing plant-based cheese he has yet discovered.’ He would know - he was part of the opening team for a past endeavor, Horizons, by Philly vegan scene pioneers, Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby."

As for special options, unlike some pizza places, they don’t skimp on the Daiya cheese, and the gluten-free pizza, while small (10”), is a great option for a pizza that’s less heavy (and won’t kill your stomach, if you have a gluten sensitivity). Most of their business comes from delivery."
