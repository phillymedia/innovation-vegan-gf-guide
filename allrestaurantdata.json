The white marble tables, fully-stocked bar and antipasti station in the restaurant tell you immediately that though they serve reasonably priced pies, they also cater to those who seek  to try their $23 tasting board. Though they have very few vegan options, their spaghetti squash small plate, which might sound like something from a deprivation diet, has an incredibly hearty flavor from the sage, garlic, roasted pine nuts in its tomato sauce. “Surely these pies are better than 98 percent of the competition,” Craig LaBan wrote in 2010, but “the pizzas aren't even nearly the best things to eat at Zavino.” The pizza is a must-try for gluten-intolerant diners, however: at the University City location, you can watch a chef spin their made-on-site gluten-free crust behind the bar (fluffy with a crunch from the wood-fired oven, it’s known in the gluten-free community as the best crust in the city)."}],"photos":[{"name":"Zavino","id":"2","url":"https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/1kcnEpxCLroM04eoImq2eQZg75A=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn/WOD4PB33YNELNL67S2S5QN2GMI.jpg","credit":"Staff Photographer","photographer":"TIM TAI","caption":"The vegetarian spaghetti squash, which can be made vegan without cheese, is pictured at Zavino in Philadelphia's University City section on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019."},{"name":"Zavino","id":"1","url":"https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/ZXv5we9pwOX0m5O0kNUc47kSFY8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn/DH5MJT5KCFAUJLTQOOHMXD2DQ4.jpg","credit":"Staff Photographer","photographer":"TIM TAI","caption":"The stache pizza with gluten-free crust is pictured at Zavino in Philadelphia's University City section on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019."}]},"frontstreetcafe":{"Name":"Front Street Cafe","Filters":"Vegan, Dairy-free, Carnivore-friendly","Dishes_to_try":"Front Street benedict with tofu scramble and mushroom scrapple (vegan, can be made gluten-free), <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/food/20160228_Fishtown_s_Front_Street_Cafe_aims_higher_than_it_achieves.html\">as featured in Craig LaBan’s review</a>; chicken bites (gluten-free, dairy free); buffalo cauliflower (vegan, gluten-free); cheesecake (vegan and gluten-free)","Go_for":"Boozy Sunday brunch date","Something_to_note":"Their menu notes whether items contain dairy, fish, meat, etc., as well as which are gluten-free.","text":[],"photos":[{"name":"Front Street Cafe","id":"","url":"https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/HuRr5ghXNs597d2NPRVhXvmgeTo=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn/public/YK44WLYZCFFBFMFDV2OWB7CC7Y.jpg","credit":"Staff Photographer","photographer":"MICHAEL BRYANT","caption":"The Front Street Benedict with tofu scramble over mushroom scrapple and hollandaise at the Front Street Café in Fishtown.
