Though they have very few vegan options, their spaghetti squash small plate, which might sound like something from a deprivation diet, has an incredibly hearty flavor from the sage, garlic, roasted pine nuts in its tomato sauce. “Surely these pies are better than 98 percent of the competition,” Craig LaBan wrote in 2010, but “the pizzas aren't even nearly the best things to eat at Zavino.” The pizza is a must-try for gluten-intolerant diners, however: at the University City location, you can watch a chef spin their made-on-site gluten-free crust behind the bar (fluffy with a crunch from the wood-fired oven, it’s known in the gluten-free community as the best crust in the city)."}],"photos":[{"name":"Zavino","id":"1","url":"https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/ZXv5we9pwOX0m5O0kNUc47kSFY8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn/DH5MJT5KCFAUJLTQOOHMXD2DQ4.jpg","credit":"Staff Photographer","photographer":"TIM TAI","caption":"The stache pizza with gluten-free crust is pictured at Zavino in Philadelphia's University City section on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019."}]}]
