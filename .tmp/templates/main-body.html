          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>Blackbird Pizzeria, an all-vegan BYOB bar food joint, is a well-recognized staple for Philadelphia vegans -- its seitan cheesesteak earned it the title of Winner of the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/v-for-vegan/Blackbird-squeaks-past-challenger-Wiz-Kid-to-retain-vegan-cheesesteak-title.html">Best Vegan Cheesesteak in Philly</a> contest in both 2016 and 2017, and it also made<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/food_department/Philly-shops-wings-are-ranked-among-best-in-US.html"> the top 10 vegan wings in the U.S. in 2014</a>. Rather than using the ubiquitous Daiya cheese, a commercially available vegan cheese made of coconut oil and tapioca, owner Mark Mebus uses Violife cheese, as the Inquirer <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/food/vegan-cheese-is-undergoing-a-revolution-in-philly-and-beyond-20180502.html">reported in 2018</a>. According to Mebus, Violife is ‘the most meltable and convincing plant-based cheese he has yet discovered.’ He would know - he was <a href="https://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2014/3/19/blackbird-pizzeria-serves-up-100-percent-vegan-pizzas.html">part of the opening team</a> for a past endeavor, Horizons, by Philly vegan scene pioneers, Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby.</p>

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>At this relaxed BYOB with counter service, don’t expect to be confined to the salads section (though they have some good options, like the kale + apple). They offer creative pizzas like the popular truffled ribeye (mozzarella ribeye, caramelized onions, white truffle oil) as well as calzones and strombolis. As for special options, unlike some pizza places, they don’t skimp on the Daiya cheese, and the gluten-free pizza, while small (10”), is a great option for a pizza that’s less heavy (and won’t kill your stomach, if you have a gluten sensitivity). Most of their business comes from delivery.</p>

        <div class="r-note">
          <strong>A tip</strong>Slice offers gluten-free crusts and vegan cheese. However, just because it’s on a gluten free crust doesn’t mean a pizza is gluten-free -- make sure to check toppings with the cashier or a manager before ordering. Another note is that their gluten-free pizzas only come in what some would consider personal-pizza size (10 inches, 6 small slices). Oh, and you can make your pizza heart-shaped (if it isn’t gluten free). Just ask.

          <strong>A tip</strong>Owned by Michael Solomonov and Steve Cook — the same award-winning team behind Zahav, Federal Donuts, and Abe Fisher — Goldie is 100 percent vegan and kosher and exceptionally accommodating of dietary restrictions. The menu is small but interesting: fluffy-crisp falafel served in Dizengoff’s pillowy pita bread (or over chopped salad), shawarma-spiced fries, and sour cherry iced tea. Even the <a href="https://twitter.com/craiglaban/status/850036488683347969?lang=en">addictively tasty</a> tehina milkshakes, which come in flavors like Turkish coffee and mint-chocolate, are dairy-free. Order at the counter for a quick pickup, and take your mediterranean feast to go, on dine in in the dimly lit space. Besides the eat-in space on Sansom Street, find Goldie at the Whole Foods’ food court on Pennsylvania Avenue as well as UPenn food hall Franklin’s Table.

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>Bareburger, an international burger chain whose Philly location has table service and a beer and wine menu, has one of the largest menus you’ll ever see - they claim it’s possible to create 81 million different burgers. Though they offer a large array of meat options as well -- bison and buttermilk-fried chicken, for example-- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/719969541546437/bareburger-philadelphia/">vegans rave</a> about its separate vegan menu with options like vegan gouda, plant-based eggs, Beyond bratwurst, and five different types of vegan burgers (including both Impossible burgers and Beyond Meat burgers). Two of their most popular vegan dishes are the Duchess, an Impossible burger with garlic aioli, mushrooms, caramelized onions, baby kale and --get this-- smoked gouda, which mirrors the Duke burger on their non-vegan menu, and the crispy brussels sprouts (vegan and gluten-free; on the heavier side, as they are fried). Their emphasis on organic ingredients makes it a bit on the pricier end of the spectrum for burger joints, but most if not all of their food, including vegan options, is hearty and rich, and they have everything vegans usually miss out on, including coconut-and-hemp milk milkshakes.</p>

          <p>Far from being a vegan-only enclave, this low-lit bar and restaurant from HipCityVeg and Bar Bombon owner Nicole Marquis attracts all different kinds of hip Philadelphians eager to taste creative cocktails like the spicy Fire Island and the ‘East of Eden.’ (So don’t forget to make reservations.)  Like the drinks, the flavors in the food are strong instead of subtle in small plates like the tofu-based ‘Our Ricotta’ with crunchy sourdough, the spicy Korean fried tofu on pickled cauliflower and the Moroccan creamed ‘spinach bakoula’ (gluten-free) with salty olives. You won’t leave feeling hungry.</p>

Everything on their gluten-free menu is Celiac safe, but if your gluten intolerance is mild rather than severe, more fried options are available to you as well (they don’t have a separate gluten-free fryer).

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>Fox & Sons Fancy Corndogs, a carnival-esque food stand that <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/Fox-and-son-corndog-stand-is-coming-to-Reading-Terminal-Market.html">opened at Reading Terminal</a> in Feb. 2017, struck a happy medium when they found a batter for their fried foods that happened to be gluten-free. The owners were inspired by the texture of Japanese and Chinese pastries, co-owner Rebecca Foxman said, which typically use a blend of rice flour and corn starch. Their entirely gluten-free menu includes corn dogs, fried broccoli bites, fried cheese curds, funnel cake, and poutine (including a vegan option). The vegan iteration of their funnel cake, the owners report, also saves food waste: they use ripe bananas that produce stands at Reading Terminal would get rid of at the end of the day to replace the buttermilk and eggs in their traditional funnel cake recipe. The store also <a href="https://www.rachaelrayshow.com/articles/check-out-fancy-corn-dogs-fox-son-philly">recently appeared on the Rachael Ray Show</a>.</p>

          <strong>A tip</strong>For those who eat meat but not dairy, you can order a regular corndog with vegan batter. They have many dairy-free extras like Daiya cheese that you can use to customize your order.

          <strong>A tip</strong>Owned by Michael Solomonov and Steve Cook — the same award-winning team behind Zahav, Federal Donuts, and Abe Fisher — Goldie is 100 percent vegan and kosher and exceptionally accommodating of dietary restrictions. The menu is small but interesting: fluffy-crisp falafel served in Dizengoff’s pillowy pita bread (or over chopped salad), shawarma-spiced fries, and sour cherry iced tea. Even the <a href="https://twitter.com/craiglaban/status/850036488683347969?lang=en">addictively tasty</a> tehina milkshakes, which come in flavors like Turkish coffee and mint-chocolate, are dairy-free. Order at the counter for a quick pickup, and take your mediterranean feast to go, on dine in in the dimly lit space. Besides the eat-in space on Sansom Street, find Goldie at the Whole Foods’ food court on Pennsylvania Avenue as well as UPenn food hall Franklin’s Table.

Now available up and down the east coast (in markets from Connecticut to Virginia), the burger doesn’t crumble like other meatless burgers, and it even earned a thumbs up from Craig Laban, who called it “a well-crafted mouthful of sweet and spicy.” At the deli, it comes with remarkably smoky gouda, sauteed mushrooms and ‘mushroom mayo.’ Another specialty is their gluten-free energy soup, a warming blend of beans, kale, quinoa, seaweed, and flax seed.</p>

The Rittenhouse restaurant has a wide ranging breakfast and lunch menu that includes everything from flavorful breakfast tacos to hearty chocolate chip pancakes — all 100% vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and almost all organic.</p>
          
          <p>Andrea Kyan founded the restaurant after she went vegan in 2007, and found a lack of sweet things for her to eat — so she started experimenting. An eventual baking business grew into the small brick’d establishment in Rittenhouse that is packed for brunch on the weekends and prides itself on curated unrefined ingredients and take conscious steps towards sustainability. Interestingly, the restaurant avoids what they <a href="https://puresweets.com/pages/faq">call</a> “unhealthful forms of soy and pea protein,” meaning they do not make or sell any processed fake meats. While those meats may be vegan, P.S. and Co says they are not the best health-wise, so they stick to plant-based materials from whole foods.</p>

          <p>You won’t see ‘tempeh sausage’ or ‘soy-based chicken’ on the menu at V Street, a plant-based, vegan restaurant and bar. James Beard-nominated chefs Rich Landau and Kate Jacoby opened V Street in 2014 as a lower-cost (but still pricey) offshoot of the wildly successful Vedge. They took inspiration from street foods around the world to create a menu that touches India (Cauliflower ‘65,’ made of crunchy papadum crackers and fried cauliflower florets in a spicy sauce), Peru (fried potato wedges with a spicy aioli), Jamaica (jerk tofu over creamy sweet potato aioli), Ethiopia and Eritrea (berbere broccoli), and Iran (Falooda, their take on the traditional Persian rosewater ice cream dish). In his glowing <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/food/20150118_LaBan_V_Street_Vedge_vegan_Landau.html">three-bell review of V Street</a>, Inquirer food critic Craig LaBan writes, ‘The way Rich Landau sees it, with animal products off his vegan table, he can't cook with half the ingredients that other chefs do: ‘So why limit ourselves to one ethnicity?’”</p>

The vegan menu is thanks in part to staff members changing their own diets. Although it’s namesake caters to “cool moms,” this colorful bar is far from a parents spot. It has plenty of bar food that people with dietary restrictions can enjoy — there are even specials like Meatless Mondays (half off the full plant-based menu) and taco Tuesdays. It also boasts a late night happy hour from 10-11pm every day, perfect for a late night snack and drink. Make sure you check out their specials for the night before you go!</p>

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>Zavino, while known for its pizza, is not a pizza joint. The white marble tables, fully-stocked bar and antipasti station in the restaurant tell you immediately that though they serve reasonably priced pies, they also cater to those who seek  to try their $23 tasting board. Though they have very few vegan options, their spaghetti squash small plate, which might sound like something from a deprivation diet, has an incredibly hearty flavor from the sage, garlic, roasted pine nuts in its tomato sauce. “Surely these pies are better than 98 percent of the competition,” Craig LaBan wrote in 2010, but “the pizzas aren't even nearly the best things to eat at Zavino.” The pizza is a must-try for gluten-intolerant diners, however: at the University City location, you can watch a chef spin their made-on-site gluten-free crust behind the bar (fluffy with a crunch from the wood-fired oven, it’s known in the gluten-free community as the best crust in the city).</p>

        <div class="r-note">
          <strong>A tip</strong>They don’t carry vegan cheese, but their pizzas can be made vegan and/or dairy free. They can make other items dairy-free, such as the brussels sprouts, spaghetti squash, the roasted cauliflower, the almond cake, and all of their salads. Their gluten-free crusts, however, contain milk.

Deeper in the cafe’s space is an extensive library of radical literature.  Their menu features many bagels, sandwiches and salads, like the popular kropotkin, which includes field roast, pesto, mixed greens, roasted red peppers, onion, and vegan mayonnaise on ciabatta, and their gourmet vegan cream cheeses, including olive, jalapeno and scallion.</p>

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>At this relaxed BYOB with counter service, don’t expect to be confined to the salads section (though they have some good options, like the kale + apple). They offer creative pizzas like the popular truffled ribeye (mozzarella ribeye, caramelized onions, white truffle oil) as well as calzones and strombolis. As for special options, unlike some pizza places, they don’t skimp on the Daiya cheese, and the gluten-free pizza, while small (10”), is a great option for a pizza that’s less heavy (and won’t kill your stomach, if you have a gluten sensitivity). Most of their business comes from delivery.</p>

          <strong>A tip</strong>Slice offers gluten-free crusts and vegan cheese. However, just because it’s on a gluten free crust doesn’t mean a pizza is gluten-free -- make sure to check toppings with the cashier or a manager before ordering. Another note is that their gluten-free pizzas only come in what some would consider personal-pizza size (10 inches, 6 small slices). Oh, and you can make your pizza heart-shaped (if it isn’t gluten free). Just ask.

This prompted Baltopoulos and her business partner Kate to open the Tasty three years ago.The Tasty is 100% vegan, and also offers an additional gluten-free menu — not everything can be made gluten-free, but there a quite a few options, including gluten-free bread and buns.

          <strong>A tip</strong>Owned by Michael Solomonov and Steve Cook — the same award-winning team behind Zahav, Federal Donuts, and Abe Fisher — Goldie is 100 percent vegan and kosher and exceptionally accommodating of dietary restrictions. The menu is small but interesting: fluffy-crisp falafel served in Dizengoff’s pillowy pita bread (or over chopped salad), shawarma-spiced fries, and sour cherry iced tea. Even the <a href="https://twitter.com/craiglaban/status/850036488683347969?lang=en">addictively tasty</a> tehina milkshakes, which come in flavors like Turkish coffee and mint-chocolate, are dairy-free. Order at the counter for a quick pickup, and take your mediterranean feast to go, on dine in in the dimly lit space. Besides the eat-in space on Sansom Street, find Goldie at the Whole Foods’ food court on Pennsylvania Avenue as well as UPenn food hall Franklin’s Table.

          <strong>A tip</strong>Although the chain is plentiful in the city, HipCityVeg is a reliable place to get a filling quick meal — but be warned, your friends who eat meat may not be fooled by their substitutes. Among their array of salad options, there are some unusual offerings worth a try, like their handful of burgers and milkshakes.

          <strong>The lowdown</strong>
          
          <p>Zavino, while known for its pizza, is not a pizza joint. The white marble tables, fully-stocked bar and antipasti station in the restaurant tell you immediately that though they serve reasonably priced pies, they also cater to those who seek  to try their $23 tasting board. Though they have very few vegan options, their spaghetti squash small plate, which might sound like something from a deprivation diet, has an incredibly hearty flavor from the sage, garlic, roasted pine nuts in its tomato sauce. “Surely these pies are better than 98 percent of the competition,” Craig LaBan wrote in 2010, but “the pizzas aren't even nearly the best things to eat at Zavino.” The pizza is a must-try for gluten-intolerant diners, however: at the University City location, you can watch a chef spin their made-on-site gluten-free crust behind the bar (fluffy with a crunch from the wood-fired oven, it’s known in the gluten-free community as the best crust in the city).</p>

        <br>
        <div class="r-note">
          <strong>A tip</strong>They don’t carry vegan cheese, but their pizzas can be made vegan and/or dairy free. They can make other items dairy-free, such as the brussels sprouts, spaghetti squash, the roasted cauliflower, the almond cake, and all of their salads. Their gluten-free crusts, however, contain milk.
